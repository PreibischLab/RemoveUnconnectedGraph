here is the new version:
 
'f' - hold key down while moving the mouse paints into the image 'left arrow' - go to previous timepoint 'right arrow' - go to next timepoint  Also the bug is removed where it got stuck ... 
 
your plugin is finally done, I actually like it  
It works on single channel and composite. If it is composite, it will ask you which channel is the segmentation channel. 
Now, here comes how it works: 
's' - shows all nodes (where lines meet, so you get an idea)
	RED - dead ends 
	MAGENTA - nodes that have two connections (and are actually therefore no nodes) - they are created when you delete one segment. They had three nodes before, now they have only two ... pressing 'r' (see below) will get rid of them
	GREEN - nodes with 3 or more segments connecting to it 'x' - remove all dead ends 'r' - re-analyze the image (if you draw something manually in there or if you want him to re-detect nodes, e.g. to get rid of the MAGENTA nodes)  mouse click - select a segment, pressing 'd' will delete it
	
	If you have more questions let me know, we can skype, here is a screenshot (one segment in the middle selected) and the jar that you have to put into the plugin directory.

Todo:
	- track just one junction over time (see Kuba's PDF)
	- press 'R' to transfer all of it to the ROI manager
